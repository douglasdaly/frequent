Code of Conduct

.. important::

    Like my Grandmother always said: *"It's nice to be nice."*


It should go without saying but please conduct yourself in a polite and
respectful manner when interacting with others.  This project has adopted
the code of conduct standards of the Python Software Foundation.  Visit
`their community code of conduct <https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/>`_
page for more information.
